It aims to solve the following use cases that grunt-contrib-connect does not seem to have an answer for:\n\n1. Enabling custom express/connect server, especially in cases when socket.io is in the mix (https://github.com/yeoman/express-stack/issues/15#issuecomment-13217532)\n2. Watch for changes to the server script(s) and restart the express/connect server (https://github.com/yeoman/express-stack/issues/7)\n\n\n## Sample app\n[grunt-express-example](https://github.com/blai/grunt-express-example) is a minimal example that shows how you can use `grunt-express` to run a basic express/socket.io server set. It will auto-restart server when change is detected.\n\n\n## Philosophy\nThe philosophy behind the birth of this mutant of grunt-contrib-connect is:\n\n1. Flexibility. I learned a few lessons from working on some enhancement to [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)'s `server` task. Express.js and Connect are so flexible that the only way to accommodate their full flexibility seems to be accepting a custom module that actually exports such object. An extreme case of this comes from [Socket.io](http://socket.io/#how-to-use), which forces http.Server, express/connect, and socket.io be instanciate in a very specific way.\n2. Grunt/Yeoman is mainly for development/deployment. When rung web server in dev environment, following features are in high demand:\n  * auto-rebuild/auto-reload (both web browser and server), livereload solved only half of this demand. While it may not be common, livereload on the browser end is also a demand for production environment, so I prefer using [tiny-rl](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr) to manage that in my server bootstrap script, rather than a grunt task.\n  * use different base directories where static contents are served. Since development/deployment process is managed by a set of grunt task (and some of the tasks are opinionated), it would seem logical to let grunt task decide which directories to load static contents from.\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-express --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-express');\n```\n\n\n## Express task\n\n### express (main task, Multi Tasks)\n_Run this task with the `grunt express` command._\n\nConfigure one or more servers for grunt to start, the minimal config would be:\n\n```javascript\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    express: {\n      default_option: {}\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-express');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('default', ['express']);\n```\n\n### express-stop\n\nYou may use this to stop one (or all) of the servers you have specified in `express` main task. If you do `grunt.task.run('express-stop')`, it will go ahead and stop all servers started by `express` multi task. You may also stop a particular server using `grunt.task.run('express-stop:SERVER_NAME')`\n\n### express-restart\n\nSimilar to `express-stop`, except that your server will be started again after stopping.\n\n### express-keepalive\n\nNote that this server only runs as long as grunt is running. Once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This behavior can be changed by appending a `express-keepalive` task at the end of your task list like so\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.registerTask('myServer', ['express', 'express-keepalive']);\n```\nNow when you run `grunt myServer`, your express server will be kept alive until you manually terminate it.\n\n Such feature can also be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt express express-keepalive`.\n\nThis design gives you the flexibility to use `grunt-express` in conjunction with another task that is run immediately afterwards, like the [grunt-contrib-qunit plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit) `qunit` task. If we force `express` task to be always async, such use case can no longer happen.\n\n\n\n## Options\n\n#### port\nType: `Integer`\nDefault: `3000`\n\nThe port on which the webserver will respond. The task will fail if the specified port is already in use.\n\n#### hostname\nType: `String`\nDefault: `'localhost'`\n\nThe hostname the webserver will use.\n\n#### bases\nType: `String|Array`\nDefault: `'.'`\n\nThe bases (or root) directories from which files will be served. Defaults to the project Gruntfile's directory.\n\n#### monitor\nType: `Object`\nDefault: `null`\n\nUnder the hood `grunt-express` uses [forever-monitor](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever-monitor) to manage individual servers in separate child processes. This makes restarting the server automatically possible. This property allow you to pass in the `forever-monitor` options. When specified, the object will be used as the options hash when creating the forever monitor to manage the server in child process.\n\n#### keepalive (WARN: no longer availabe in 0.20+)\n#### Please use a trailing `express-keepalive` task instead\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: `false`\n\nKeep the server alive indefinitely. Note that if this option is enabled, any tasks specified after this task will _never run_. By default, once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This option changes that behavior.\n\n#### debug\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: `false`\n\nTurning this option on will make the \"supervised\" express|connect instance output more debugging messages.\n\n#### server\nType: `String`\nDefault: null\n\nThis option allows you to specify a path to a Node.js module that exports a \"connect-like\" object. Such object should have the following two functions:\n\n1. `use(route, fn)` (https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L62)\n2. `listen()` (https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L227)\n_note: you DO NOT want to call the listen() from within your server module, `express` task will take care of that for you_\n\nThe simplest example would be:\n```js\nvar connect = require('connect');\nmodule.exports = connect();\n```\n\nor if you prefer express.js\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello!');\n});\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\nor if you want to use both express and socket.io\n```js\nvar app = require('express')()\n  , server = require('http').createServer(app)\n  , io = require('socket.io').listen(server);\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.sendfile(__dirname + '/index.html');\n});\n\nio.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {\n  socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });\n  socket.on('my other event', function (data) {\n    console.log(data);\n  });\n});\n\nexports = module.exports = server;\n// delegates user() function\nexports.use = function() {\n  app.use.apply(app, arguments);\n};\n```\n\nWhen `server` option is not set, `express` task will generate a plain `connect` object for you.\n\n_note: `express` task will generate `static` and `directory` middleware for each of the `bases` you specified, and load them onto your server (or the generated server) object by calling `use()` function_\n\n[project Gruntfile]: Gruntfile.js\n[project unit tests]: test/express_test.js\n\n### Usage examples\n\n#### Basic Use\nIn this example, `grunt express` (or more verbosely, `grunt express:server`) will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile, and any tasks run afterwards will be able to access it.\n\n```javascript\n// Project configuration.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  express: {\n    server: {\n      options: {\n        port: 9001,\n        bases: 'www-root'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou may specify more than one `bases` like so. Enhancing the above example, now your server will server static content from both `www-root` folder and `app/public` folder (both are relative path to the `Gruntfile.js`)\n\n```javascript\n// Project configuration.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  express: {\n    server: {\n      options: {\n        port: 9001,\n        bases: ['www-root', 'app/public']\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf you want your web server to use the default options, just omit the `options` object. You still need to specify a target (`uses_defaults` in this example), but the target's configuration object can otherwise be empty or nonexistent. In this example, `grunt express` (or more verbosely, `grunt express:uses_defaults`) will start a static web server using the default options.\n\n```javascript\n// Project configuration.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  connect: {\n    uses_defaults: {}\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Multiple Servers\nYou can specify multiple servers to be run alone or simultaneously by creating a target for each server. In this example, running either `grunt connect:site1` or `grunt connect:site2` will  start the appropriate web server, but running `grunt connect` will run _both_. Note that any server for which the [keepalive](#keepalive) option is specified will prevent _any_ task or target from running after it.\n\n```javascript\n// Project configuration.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  express: {\n    site1: {\n      options: {\n        port: 9000,\n        bases: 'www-roots/site1'\n      }\n    },\n    site2: {\n      options: {\n        port: 9001,\n        bases: 'www-roots/site2'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Custom express\nLike the [Basic Use](#basic-use) example, this example will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile. Unlike the other example, this will use your custom server script as referred to by `server`! We also set `keepalive` and `watchChanges` to true, so the server will run forever (until you terminate the command), also the server will restart when you apply any changes to your server script.\n\n```javascript\n// Project configuration.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  express: {\n    custom: {\n      options: {\n        port: 9001,\n        bases: 'www-root',\n        server: path.resolve('./server/main')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nany in your `server/main.js`, we reuse the previous sample server script\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('hello!');\n});\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n(open [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) and you should see \"hello!\")\n\nNow let's change `server/main.js`'s content to:\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.send('bonjour!');\n});\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n(refresh browser and you should see \"bonjour!\")\n\n\n## Release History\n * 2013-04-25 `v0.3.3` use forever-monitor npm v1.2.1\n * 2013-03-24 `v0.3.2` fixed npm v1.2.15 compatibility issue\n * 2013-03-14 `v0.3.0` support 'debug-brk' option for launching server in child process (so it can be linked to a remote debugger); also point forever-monitor dependency to its github verion (has fix for accepting 'debug-brk' options)\n * 2013-03-13 `v0.2.2` do not defalt hostname to \"localhost\" when none is provided as that will prevent access to the server through IP addres\n * 2013-03-11 `v0.2.1` Make static directories not browsable as it breaks twitter bootstrap (suggested by @hmalphettes)\n * 2013-02-28 `v0.2.0` Switch to use forever-monitor (instead of node-supervisor). Removed \"keepalive\" option, instead enable the feature using \"express-keepalive\" task.\n * 2013-02-25 `v0.1.3` Fixes #1, changing option \"watchChanges\" to \"supervisor\".\n * 2013-02-24 `v0.1.1` Added missing \"connect\" dependency, factored out some logic to util.js.\n * 2013-02-23 `v0.1.0` first draft.\n\n",
